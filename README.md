# Transferator
REST API for a money-transferring application

##Main Features:
- An endpoint to get the current balance of a given user.
- An endpoint to make a transfer of money between two users.
- Dockerized

##Design decisions and assumptions:
- A specific user can only have one account in the system
- I'm leaving out the scope of this exercise the currencies, therefore there is a unique (implicit) currency

## Structure and design
The solution is modularized (gradle) in the following components:

`application`: Contains the business logic that implements the application use cases. 
I've chosen Cucumber to define the tests for validating the use cases.
